# HEG ESP32 - Delobotomizer Edition

Official repository for the HEGduino V2 Delobotomizer firmware, software, and designs.

The firmware folder includes extra libraries needed for Arduino, but you will need to install the Espressif packages for the ESP32 into Arduino.

This repo is being updated shortly with detailed instructions. For now, you can follow along from the [original repo](https://github.com/moothyknight/HEG_ESP32) on how to install the chrome extension. 

The Chrome Extension in this repo is configured for the Delobotomizer's output format. I will be updating it to select protocols automatically, it only effects the CSV auto formatting right now so either version should still work for both devices.
